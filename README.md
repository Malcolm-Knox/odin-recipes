#First GitHub Project 
Project will need for me to create a simple recipe website using the html language.
The website will need a home page that creates links to three other pages that each feature a different recipe.
Each webpage should have a picture of the cooked recipe, a description of the recipe, the ingredients and finally the steps to make the recipe.
